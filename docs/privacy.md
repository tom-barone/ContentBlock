This extension stores no Personally Identifiable Information.

When you install the extension and before submitting a vote, a randomly generated [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) is created for you and saved locally to your browser storage.

When you vote, the following data is sent and stored in the database:
- The URL of the page you are voting on.
- Your vote value (+1 or -1).
- The user UUID.
- The timestamp (e.g. `2023-02-02T09:36:03Z`).

Data is only sent and stored when you click a vote button.

Icon preferences are stored locally in your browser storage.
