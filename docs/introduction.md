Hello friend ðŸ’š

Welcome to ContentBlock.

The vision of this community is to filter out unhelpful content on the web, and to make it easier to find the good stuff.

Your votes are what makes this system work.

The 2 rules of thumb when voting are:

1. If you find a great website and genuinely believe others could benefit from it, give it an upvote ðŸ’š
2. When you find a website that is objectively helpful to _no one_, give it a downvote ðŸ’¢

Here's a leaderboard of the most loved sites to start you off:
